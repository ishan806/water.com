<h9><u> frost and snow</u>  --- </h9> <h10> it is water in solid form, it forms due to low tempreture, the snow on mountains when melt because increase in tempreture, it turn in liquid state
 making small streams and flow down through the slope, and these streams joins togather and forms larger streams, gragually they became bigger and bigger 
forming rivers, the speed of river increases as it flows down the slope.</h10>
